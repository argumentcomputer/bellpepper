# bellperson [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bellperson.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/bellperson)

> This is a fork of the great [bellman](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman) library.

`bellman` is a crate for building zk-SNARK circuits. It provides circuit traits
and primitive structures, as well as basic gadget implementations such as
booleans and number abstractions.

## Backend

There is currently one backend available for the implementation of Bls12 381:
- [`blstrs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/blstrs) - optimized with hand tuned assembly, using [blst](https://github.com/supranational/blst)

## GPU

This fork contains GPU parallel acceleration to the FFT and Multiexponentation algorithms in the groth16 prover codebase under the compilation features `cuda` and `opencl`.

### Requirements
- NVIDIA or AMD GPU Graphics Driver
- OpenCL

( For AMD devices we recommend [ROCm](https://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html) )

### Environment variables

The gpu extension contains some env vars that may be set externally to this library.

- `BELLMAN_NO_GPU`

    Will disable the GPU feature from the library and force usage of the CPU.

    ```rust
    // Example
    env::set_var("BELLMAN_NO_GPU", "1");
    ```

- `BELLMAN_VERIFIER`

    Chooses the device in which the batched verifier is going to run. Can be `cpu`, `gpu` or `auto`.

    ```rust
    Example
    env::set_var("BELLMAN_VERIFIER", "gpu");
    ```

- `BELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU`

    Will allow for adding a GPU not in the tested list. This requires researching the name of the GPU device and the number of cores in the format `["name:cores"]`.

    ```rust
    // Example
    env::set_var("BELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU", "GeForce RTX 2080 Ti:4352, GeForce GTX 1060:1280");
    ```

- `BELLMAN_CPU_UTILIZATION`

    Can be set in the interval [0,1] to designate a proportion of the multiexponenation calculation to be moved to cpu in parallel to the GPU to keep all hardware occupied.

    ```rust
    // Example
    env::set_var("BELLMAN_CPU_UTILIZATION", "0.5");
    ```

- `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`

   Restricts the number of threads used in the library to roughly twice that number (best effort). In the past this was done using `BELLMAN_NUM_CPUS` which is now deprecated. The default is set to the number of logical cores reported on the machine.

   ```rust
    // Example
    env::set_var("RAYON_NUM_THREADS", "6");
   ```

 - `BELLMAN_GPU_FRAMEWORK`

     Bellman can be compiled with both, OpenCL and CUDA support. When both are available, `BELLMAN_GPU_FRAMEWORK` can be used to set it to a specific one, either `cuda` or `opencl`.

    ```rust
    // Example
    env::set_var("BELLMAN_GPU_FRAMEWORK", "opencl");
    ```

 - `BELLMAN_CUDA_NVCC_ARGS`

     By default the CUDA kernel is compiled for several architectures, which may take a long time. `BELLMAN_CUDA_NVCC_ARGS` can be used to override those arguments. The input and output file will still be automatically set.

    ```rust
    // Example for compiling the kernel for only the Turing architecture
    env::set_var("BELLMAN_CUDA_NVCC_ARGS", "--fatbin --gpu-architecture=sm_75 --generate-code=arch=compute_75,code=sm_75");
    ```


#### Supported / Tested Cards

Depending on the size of the proof being passed to the gpu for work, certain cards will not be able to allocate enough memory to either the FFT or Multiexp kernel. Below are a list of devices that work for small sets. In the future we will add the cuttoff point at which a given card will not be able to allocate enough memory to utilize the GPU.

### Running Tests

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo test --release --all
```

To run using CUDA and OpenCL, you can use:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo test --release --all --features cuda,opencl
```

To run the multiexp_consistency test you can use:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo test --features cuda,opencl -- --exact multiexp::gpu_multiexp_consistency --nocapture
```

### Considerations

Bellperson uses `rust-gpu-tools` as its CUDA/OpenCL backend, therefore you may see a
directory named `~/.rust-gpu-tools` in your home folder, which contains the
compiled binaries of OpenCL kernels used in this repository.
